# Contributing Guide

How to set up, code, test, review, and release so contributions meet our Definition of Done.

## Code of Conduct

Reference the project/community behavior expectations and reporting process.

### Behavior expectations
* Be respectful 
    * Feedback should be constructive and focused on improving the end product
    * Don't dismiss ideas out of hand
* Be honest
* Be inclusive. Make sure everyone has a chance to share their opinions during meetings or other important discussions.

### Reporting process
* If someone has been acting disrespectfully or violates one of our policies, message them first to discuss your issues with their actions
* If this fails to resolve the issue, bring up the issue at the next meeting for the group to discuss.

## Getting Started

List prerequisites, setup steps, environment variables/secrets handling, and how to run the app locally.

### Prerequisites 
* An emulator or a mobile device that can run the app. See this guide for setting up environment https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/?platform=ios&device=simulated 
    * If you want to run the app on a mobile device, you will need to download the Expo Go app.
* Nodejs v24 isntalled
* Git installed

### How to run app locally
* Clone the repo using ```git clone https://github.com/lethangomes/AI-Textbook-Capstone.git```
* cd into AI-Textnook-Capstone/AI-Textbook-App
* run ```npm install```
* run ```npx expo install prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier --dev``` on mac or ```npx expo install prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier "--" --dev``` on windows to install prettier
* run one of the following commands to start the app
    * ```npm run start``` - Brings up QR code for running app on mobile and a menu to switch to android/iOS emulation
    * ```npm run ios``` - requires iOS emulator
    * ```npm run android``` - requires android emulator
* If you're running an emulator, the app should automatically open in the emulator. If you're using a mobile device, use the first option and scan the QR code.

## Branching & Workflow

Describe the workflow (e.g., trunk-based or GitFlow), default branch, branch naming, and when to rebase vs. merge.
  * We will use trunk-based workflow.
  * Default is main.
  * Before starting any work, always pull for latest changes.
  * Create your own branch with branch naming based on the feature being worked on.
  * Make small commits.
  * Open pull request and make sure the additions pass all tests.
  * Once approved, merge with main.
  * Delete branch after the merge. 


## Issues & Planning

Explain how to file issues, required templates/labels, estimation, and triage/assignment practices.
   We can use GitHub Issues to file issues. We will make an issue template.
   Labels:
   * Bugs : A bug that needs to be fixed
   * Feature : is a feature that needs to be implemented
   * Task : Anything thats not a feature that needs to be done

     Use GitHub Issues to assign priorities in the labels (low, medium, high).

## Commit Messages

State the convention (e.g., Conventional Commits), include examples, and how to reference issues.

## Code Style, Linting & Formatting

Name the formatter/linter, config file locations, and the exact commands to check/fix locally.

We are using ESLint and Prettier for formatting/linting. The config file is ```./AI-textbook-App/eslint.config.js```. To check linting, run ```npx expo lint```.

## Testing

Define required test types, how to run tests, expected coverage thresholds, and when new/updated tests are mandatory.

We are still deciding on a testing solution, but we intend to have the following tests:
* Unit tests
    * Should be added whenever a new feature is added
    * Should be updated whenever bugs are found with existing features, or existing features are altered.
* End to End tests
    * Should be added whenever new UI elements are introduced
    * Should be updated whenever UI is altered significantly

## Pull Requests & Reviews

Outline PR requirements (template, checklist, size limits), reviewer expectations, approval rules, and required status checks.

Pull request template is in PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md and includes a self check checklist.

### Reviewer Expectations
* Review should be conducted within 24 hours of PR submission.
* Review should be constructive and respectful, focusing on ensuring the quality of the end product.
* If PR is rejected, reviewer must cite specific reasons for rejection and potential ways to fix any issues.

### Approval rules
* For a PR to be approved, it must pass all tests and be reviewed by at least one other group member.
* Should also correctly follow PR template


## CI/CD

Link to pipeline definitions, list mandatory jobs, how to view logs/re-run jobs, and what must pass before merge/release.

We do not currently have CI jobs set up, but we intend to have jobs for running unit tests, linter, security scan, and checking formatting on pull request.

## Security & Secrets

State how to report vulnerabilities, prohibited patterns (hard-coded secrets), dependency update policy, and scanning tools.

### Reporting vulnerabilities
Any discovered vulnerabilities should be brought up at the next meeting. If vulnerability is critical an emergency meeting should be held as soon as possible.

### Prohibited patterns
* No secrets should be hard coded. All secrets should be in environment variables or .env files. If stored in a file, the file should be in .gitignore

### Scanning tools
We intend to use githubs builtin secret scanner

## Documentation Expectations

Specify what must be updated (README, docs/, API refs, CHANGELOG) and docstring/comment standards.

### Docstring/Comment standards
All functions should have comments above them with
* A brief description of what they do
* All input arguments and any constraints they may have
* Function output

## Release Process

Describe versioning scheme, tagging, changelog generation, packaging/publishing steps, and rollback process.

## Support & Contact

Provide maintainer contact channel, expected response windows, and where to ask questions.
